# Python 2.7 C-API Extension Project Documentation

Welcome to the Python 2.7 C-API Extension Project documentation.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to create Python C extensions using the Python 2.7
C-API with modern development practices including Docker containerization,
GitHub Actions CI/CD, and comprehensive testing.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start Jupyter notebook server
make jupyter

# Build and test in Docker container
make dev

# Interactive development shell
make shell
```

## Documentation Sections

- [API Documentation](api.md) - Generated API documentation
- [Development Guide](development.md) - Development workflows
- [Docker Setup](docker.md) - Container environment details
- [CI/CD Pipeline](cicd.md) - GitHub Actions workflows

## Features

- 🐳 **Docker Development Environment**: Complete containerized development setup
- 📊 **Jupyter Integration**: Interactive development and testing
- 🚀 **GitHub Actions CI/CD**: Automated testing, building, and deployment
- 🔒 **Security Scanning**: CodeQL and Trivy vulnerability analysis
- 📝 **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automated code quality checks
- 🏗️ **Multi-stage Docker Builds**: Optimized production images

## Architecture

This project uses a multi-stage Docker build approach:

1. **Builder Stage**: Compiles C extensions and installs dependencies
2. **Runtime Stage**: Minimal runtime environment with built extensions

The GitHub Actions pipeline includes:

- **Pre-commit Checks**: Code formatting and linting
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, and performance tests
- **Security Analysis**: Vulnerability scanning with Trivy and CodeQL
- **Documentation**: Automated API documentation generation
- **Publishing**: Docker image publishing to GitHub Container Registry
